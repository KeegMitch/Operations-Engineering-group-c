# Note that our times are for when the systems are in NZST, default is UTC, so 12am UTC time is 12pm NZST

We also have different times for our manual scripts and our Puppet scripts, so they all run about 4 times a day (every 6 hours)



# mgmt-c server

For our manual one this will backup from 12am NZST:
